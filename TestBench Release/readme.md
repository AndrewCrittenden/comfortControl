## Implements our designed framework in an easy to use Windows application 

Emulates the Raspberry Pi server's end of the handshaking protocol 

## Features: 

Authenticate – Implements the authentication process over the computer Wi-Fi adapter's subnet mask, can authenticate all devices within a 20 second timeout period 

Request Sensor Data – Begins the data request query over the TCP connection of all nodes, and retrieves their sent sensor data (unique to each sensor) 

Clear Devices – Clears Device List 

Start Auto – Begins automatically querying the nodes every 20 seconds, simulating the server (with a shorter time period between queries for testing purposes) 

Test Fridge – Sends information to the heating/cooling device, changing its value 

Choose-WiFi-Adapter – Due to more than one adapter being on a PC, this allows you to select the adapter you're using for this project 

Save/Clear Logs – Does things to the log on the right 

 
### Devices should appear with their information in the list if validated properly:
