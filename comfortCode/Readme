This code runs in python 3.7 with the pythermalcomfort library. Found here:https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/pythermalcomfort

It is set up to run with fake data for testing until real data can be received
on the pi. 

Could be used to test pipe communication between the gui and the c++ code.
